# Reinforcement Learning (RL)

## Dynamic Programming
Implemented value prediction (Iterative Policy Evaluation) and value iteration algorithms to solve Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).

## Monte-Carlo Methods
Developed off-policy Monte-Carlo evaluation using both ordinary and weighted importance sampling.

## Temporal Difference (TD) Learning
Built on-policy n-step TD for policy evaluation and off-policy n-step SARSA for learning optimal policies
